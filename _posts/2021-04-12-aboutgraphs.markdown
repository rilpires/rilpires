title: About graphs
---

*"About graphs"* is a simple web tool to construct graphs and visualize some info about it. The idea was for a initial concept of my final project that I gave up later.


<br>
It was made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot engine</a>. It can't scale very well further than 25~ vertices... <span class="smoll">Dijkstra is applied for every pair each time a change is made.</span>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeness_centrality">Centrality</a> is defined for each vertex as the inverse of the average minimum distance to each other vertex.
    </li> <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_index">Wiener index</a> is defined as the sum of all shortest paths of a connected graph.
    </li> <li>
        Eccentricity is defined for each vertex as the largest minimum distance to a connected vertex.
    </li>

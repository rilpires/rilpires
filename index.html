Hello, my name is Romeu, I'm from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and this is one of the few public photos available of me:

{% include image.html width="30%" src="/assets/images/me.jpg" subtile="I really like this photo of me because it was took from a trail with friends before Covid-19 and brings me happy memories" %}
<br>
<br>

I'm an <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">almost</span> graduated student of Computer Science from UFRJ(Federal University of Rio the Janeiro).

<br>

<span class="smoll">Almost because I still have to complete my final project that I am postponing it since my last internship</span>

I'm interested in computer science overall. I'm used to code in C++ and Python, apart from programming games with <a href="https://www.godotengine.org/">Godot</a> engine. 
I also had fun with IoT programming. I hope to keep publishing some of my previous & future personal projects in this blog. 
I'm also interested in some creative process like drawing and 3d-modelling, although in these I didn't participated recently.

<p>
    First semester of Computer Science. As soon as I learned some C programming and have read about <a href="https://liballeg.org/">Allegro5</a>, 
    I was very excited to try to program what I thought it would be a ~simple~ Dwarf-fortress-like game.
    That's how <i>Blindrl</i> was born. The name <i>Blindrl</i> came from "blind roguelike", because I considered myself blind when thinking 
    about the scope of it, so anyone could predict the successfull outcome of it. 
</p>
<p>
    Me previous experience with game development was only some obscure old Dragon Ball RPGMaker 2000 clones back around in 2004. 
    There is no records available of these today... so <i>Blindrl</i> will probably be the most ever old record of all the games I developed.
    Worked on it for about 2 months I guess.
</p>
<p>
    I couldn't recover any source code of it, neither any executable. I've never used git at the time. I can clearly remember how messy the code was,
    I didn't followed any pattern, peaked naiveness there. It was just code appending after code appending.
    I remember that it was at the moment I had to implement a collision-checking algorithm to it that I gave up, 
    it was done in the most simple way (the O(NÂ²) one we all know about, checking everything against everything), so 
    when I made the trees to act like any entity, goodbye FPS. 
</p>
<p>
    These are all the records I could find: some gifs I've recorded to show to a friend through e-mail.

<h2>Assets</h2>
<p>
    99% of the assets came from 
    <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/dawnlike-16x16-universal-rogue-like-tileset-v181">this DragonDePlatino's bundle</a>.
    I did use this tileset in another project 3~ years later.
